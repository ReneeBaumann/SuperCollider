Final Project Idea:

I currently have 2 ideas for my final project. 

First I thought about a recreation of my analysis project. So a never ending musical piece which spawns randomly. 

The other idea was to create something similar to the Bird GUI we saw in class. I am not sure if my skill level is good enough to create something like that, nevertheless it looked cool and would be a fun interactive music piece.
